## Hackintosh Guide Tools

This project contains various scripts and tools common to my hackintosh guide projects.

The projects using these scripts:

- HP Haswell Envy series (J/K/N/Q)

- Lenovo u430

- Lenovo Y50

- HP Probook/Elitebook/ZBook

- Intel NUC (5/6/7/8)

- Intel DH67xx

Unless you're planning to create you own guide with automated scripts, this project is not directly useful to you.  Refer to my other projects to see how this project is used with them.
